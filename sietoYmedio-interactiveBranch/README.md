# sietoYmedio

This a single-player version of the card game known as 'siete y medio' (seven and a half), which is very similar in nature to the casino game of Blackjack (also known as 21).

Made a few commits to master branch for function and class implementation. Then created interactiveBranch outside of master branch to experiment with user interaction and messages that appear on the console, had classmate fix bug in interactiveBranch, accepted pull request, and then merged interactiveBranch with the master branch. The sietoYmedio-interactiveBranch folder within the master branch is the most updated version of my project
