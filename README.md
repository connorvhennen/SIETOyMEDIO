# sietoYmedio

This a single-player version of the card game known as 'siete y medio' (seven and a half), which is very similar in nature to the casino game of Blackjack (also known as 21).

Made a few commits to master branch for function and class implementation. Then created interactiveBranch outside of master branch to experiment with user interaction and messages that appear on the console, had classmate fix bug in interactiveBranch, accepted pull request, and then merged interactiveBranch with the master branch. Then I had a sietoYmedio-interactiveBranch folder within the master branch as the most updated version of my project. Then I moved the files within the folder to the master branch's primary directory. Finally, I deleted all the files and folders that were accidentally created in the branching, pulling and merging and process. Now the master branch is clean with the most updated files at the primary directory.
